<h1>Music Player</h1>

<p>This React Native front end project is a free time hobby project with no greater goals than improving my React Native skills. It is inspired by an mockup I've done a couple of years a go.</p>

<p>The first step will be creating a "Playlists" screen with working functionalities with some sample data. Later on also a music streaming API will be integrated to the project. The aim is to create clean, well structured code.</p>
<p>This README will be updated with more project details later.</p>
